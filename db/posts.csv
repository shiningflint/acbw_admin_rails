          <div class=""post-block""><p>Odaiba, My first cycling adventure in Tokyo after I got my ride. Up until now I only have been there by riding trains. I cannot tell how far a place is going by that long metal snake on rails. It felt far.</p><p>I took a little detour along the way passing Tokyo Tower, love the nice clear sunny weather. Still not used by the traffic rules around, took longer than I should. But it was quite a trip to reach the Rainbow Bridge.</p><p>As I got close to the entrance, there was an officer guarding the entrance. He told me to cross the rainbow bridge by foot and my bicycle has to be strapped on a small flat cart. There goes my excitement riding through the Rainbow Bridge.<br></p></div>

The trip has gotten more challenging once I covered most of the trip leaving the most fun part and paddle all the way to the destination just for the sake of it. Thoughts on going home after finishing the tour around the park went into my head.</p><p>It was very tempting to stop and go back. In that kind of situation, it is better to ask yourself “Will I regret it if I stopped and turn around?”. Asking that question to myself gave me motivation to turn the wheel some more until I see the place.</p><p>The reason why I kept going on is quite personal. I read about this blog about this shiba inu tobacco store clerk, then I watched more video blogs talking about it. Even though it got retired by the time I reached Tokyo, I still want to deal with my feelings just to let it out (sounds like confessing to someone you like).</p><p>The sun sets quicker compared to summer. Gotta go back home quicker than usual. Maybe it is a normal thing to have it in a four seasonal land. But in Indonesia the sunrises and sunsets are forever the same, unless something catastrophic happens like if the earth’s polar is shifting. So that concludes my trip of the day.</p></div>

They might fence out the whole area and would left me disappointed.</p><p>“Maybe next week”, that thought came to mind. The weather had been cloudy and raining the past 2 weeks. But I had the time that day, just go with it anyway.</p><p>My first 5 kilometers are the most decisive part. Just knowing the line “Start Now!” is good, but actually make it into practice is a different matter. Imagining all the uncertainties was really demotivating.
